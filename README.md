# Epicodus Track Suggester

#### _A webpage designed to help prospective students pick an Epicodus' track that suits their interests, 09.15.2017_

#### By _James C. Osborn_

## Description

_This is a website designed to help prospective Epicodus students find a course that matches their interests and background. The website asks the user a series of 5 questions, and based upon the answers to those questions recommends 1 of 4 tracks offered at Epicodus. Possible track suggestions include: C#/.Net, Ruby/Rails, PHP/Drupal, and Java/Android. Questions 1 and 5 do not affect the track suggested, as front-end/back-end and experience isn't the most important in matching a track to someone's background. The user is able to change their answers and hit the submit button multiple times to see how suggestions differ based on the answers given._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Install Atom -- https://atom.io/_
* _Install and run Git -- https://git-scm.com/_
* _Clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/jamescosborn/track-suggester_
* _Navigate to the where you've stored the /track-suggester directory with Git_
* _Type in the command line, "atom ."_

_Included in the git repository are several files, including: bootstrap.css, styles.css, atom.png (unused), dragon.png, jquery-3.2.1.js, scripts.js, index.html, and this README.md._

_The easiest way to see this website in a browser is to drag the index.html tab from Atom in to a Chrome browser window. Alternatively, the user can double click on the index.html in the /track-suggestor directory and the website will open in the user's default browser._

## Known Bugs

_-Resizing the browser window to be very narrow will cause the dragon.png in the upper right to jump down a line or two, looking less than ideal._

_-Using an unsupported browser (something other than Chrome) may cause unintended issues._

_-If some boxes are left blank, results (suggestedTrack) may display a blank value. User can fill in blank boxes and resubmit without having to refresh the page._

## Support and contact details

_All bugs and feedback are encouraged to be emailed to [jamescarlosborn@gmail.com](mailto:jamescarlosborn@gmail.com)._

## Technologies Used

_Used HTML to design the webpage, CSS and BootStrap for styling, and JS and JQuery to make the form evaluate answers and return a tailored response._
